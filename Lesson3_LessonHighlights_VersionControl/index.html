            <p class="lead"> GitHub is simply a source code repository using the git version control system. It's more for managing each iteration of your code while it's under development, not really for storing a change log. 

When you fork a project on GitHub, you're essentially copying that person's source code into your repository. You can make changes to it and make it a new project. For example, someone could make an image manipulation library with 80% of the features that you want. You could fork it and add the remaining 20% of the feature that you need.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is the software that runs at the heart of GitHub. Git is version control software, which means it manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of that project. Git involves several components such as the command line - The computer program we use to input Git commands. On a Mac, it’s called Terminal – and  the repository - a directory or storage space where your projects can live. Version Control is the purpose Git was designed to serve. When one has a Microsoft Word file, they either overwrite every saved file with a new save, or save multiple versions. Git negates this. It keeps “snapshots” of every point in time in the project’s history, so one can never lose or overwrite it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. It’s a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you mess things up or lose files, you can easily recover. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. A git repository contains, among other things, a set of commit objects and a set of references to commit objects. To create a repository, create a directory for the project if it doesn’t exist, enter it, and run the command git init. There is only one .git directory, in the root directory of the project. The repository is stored in files alongside the project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are several main git command. Git config sets configuration values for your user name, email, gpg key, preferred diff algorithm, file formats; git init initializes a git repository – creates the initial ‘.git’ directory in a new or in an existing project; git clone makes a Git repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions; git add adds files changes in your working directory to your index; git commit takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it and sets the branch to point to that new commit.</p>
